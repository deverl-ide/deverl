Platform dependent issues:

The following two lines cause window display issues in Windows 7. Although widened to the specified dimension, the sash displays retained data (i.e. the notebooks margin).

  % wxSplitterWindow:setSashSize(SplitterTopBottom, 8),
  % wxSplitterWindow:setSashSize(SplitterLeftRight, 8),

They are required on MacOSX so that the default sash image is visible, although this is only a minor visual issue (which we can probably ignore).
